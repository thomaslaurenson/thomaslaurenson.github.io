    IoT Dunedin is a student project I supervise that is run by the Otago Polytechnic Bachelor of Information Technology degree. We research, develop and implement Internet of Things solutions, primarily using LoRaWAN. W have implemented an open LoRaWAN network in Dunedin City, consisting of multiple LoRaWAN gateway devices, providing a long-range wireless network for embedded smart devices to connect to. We also provide the back-end server infrastructure that allows end-users to view or collect the data from their nodes. We provide a variety of development documentation ranging from building LoRaWAN sensor nodes, to web, mobile and desktop applications for end-users.
