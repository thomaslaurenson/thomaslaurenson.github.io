The main reason was I needed a static IP - something that I have to pay for from my lackluster ISP. Instead, I set up a WireGuard VPN on a cloud VPS - based on advice from a SysAdmin friend. This blog post documents my process on setting up WireGuard on a fresh Digital Ocean Droplet (VPS) and covers some things I didn’t find in some other tutorials.

It was a blast to play some SNES, PS1, and Amiga games. But like usual, I seem to have more fun tinkering with these things than playing games for hours on end… I recently stumbled on an interesting project called re3 - a reverse engineering project of the original Grand Theft Auto 3.

I have dabbled with a little emulation of older consoles from my childhood - things like Sega Mastersystem, Playstation 1, and Amiga 500 emulation. In the past, I just set up an emulator on my Linux laptop (Thinkpad BTW) played around a little, tweaked some settings, then got bored. The problem was I wanted more games, more emulators for different platforms, and a proper controller instead of a keyboard/mouse. However, the biggest thing I…","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-02-20/retropie-building-a-retro-game-console-in-a-day/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-02-20","tags":["RetroPie","Raspberry Pi","Retro","Linux"],"title":"RetroPie - Building a Retro Game Console in a Day","description":"A journey of building a retro game console using a Raspberry Pi with RetroPie in a single day.","thumbnail":"retropie.png"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Been a while since I blogged about stuff. The perils of changing jobs and moving cities numerous times in the last couple of years put a bit of a block on any progress. Looking at my personal website/portfolio in 2021 made me a little sad - outdated and unloved. So, I took some time to do a rewrite using some of the skills I have learned since I last was developing the website - namely JavaScript, React, and Gatsby.
