The main reason was I needed a static IP - something that I have to pay for from my lackluster ISP. Instead, I set up a WireGuard VPN on a cloud VPS - based on advice from a SysAdmin friend. This blog post documents my process on setting up WireGuard on a fresh Digital Ocean Droplet (VPS) and covers some things I didn’t find in some other tutorials. The main difference between other tutorials I read - I wanted a VPN for internet…","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-08-06/building-a-wireguard-vpn/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-08-06","tags":["WireGuard","VPN","Linux"],"title":"Building a WireGuard VPN","description":"Tutorial of how I built a WireGuard VPN to get a static IP, and for anonymous Internet access.","thumbnail":"wireguard.png"}},{"excerpt":"My last post was about Building a retro gaming machine in a day- where I got a Raspberry Pi 4, a PS4 controller, and installed RetroPie. It was a blast to play some SNES, PS1, and Amiga games. But like usual, I seem to have more fun tinkering with these things than playing games for hours on end… I recently stumbled on an interesting project called re3 - a reverse engineering project of the original Grand Theft Auto 3. After a little reading, I discovered the project had excellent Linux support…","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-03-05/gta3-on-the-retropie/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-03-05","tags":["RetroPie","Raspberry Pi","Retro","Linux"],"title":"Grand Theft Auto 3 on the RetroPie","description":"Tutorial of how to install the re3 project (GTA3) on a Raspberry Pi 4 running RetroPie.","thumbnail":"retropiegta.png"}},{"excerpt":"I have wanted a retro gaming setup for about 10 years! I have dabbled with a little emulation of older consoles from my childhood - things like Sega Mastersystem, Playstation 1, and Amiga 500 emulation. In the past, I just set up an emulator on my Linux laptop (Thinkpad BTW) played around a little, tweaked some settings, then got bored. The problem was I wanted more games, more emulators for different platforms, and a proper controller instead of a keyboard/mouse. However, the biggest thing I…","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2021-02-20/retropie-building-a-retro-game-console-in-a-day/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-02-20","tags":["RetroPie","Raspberry Pi","Retro","Linux"],"title":"RetroPie - Building a Retro Game Console in a Day","description":"A journey of building a retro game console using a Raspberry Pi with RetroPie in a single day.","thumbnail":"retropie.png"}},{"excerpt":"This post summarizes a simple method to secure, or lock-down, SSH access using the Restricted SSH () package. The basic premise, you can create a user with a restricted shell and allow only specific protocols such as SCP or SFTP.

The gateway connects an internal network to an external network - basically, performing Network Address Translation (NAT) for hosts on the internal network. It is exceptionally similar to what your ISP supplied home router does. To achieve this, an Ubuntu Linux server is configured as a DHCP server and also to provide NAT using .
