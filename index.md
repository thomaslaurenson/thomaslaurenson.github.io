A lecturer in the Bachelor of Information Technology (BIT) program at Otago Polytechnic in Dunedin, New Zealand. Recently finished my PhD candidature at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. I currently reside in Dunedin, however, I was bought up in and lived most of my life in Auckland, New Zealand. 

I currently teach the following courses at Otago Polytech:

+ Introduction to Computer Security (500 level)
+ Operating Systems: Linux (500 level)
+ BIT Project: LoRaWAN Project Group (600 level)

My PhD research topic was in the field of Digital Forensics. Specifically, automated forensic analysis of application software artifacts. The application software being investigated was centered on anti-forensic tool usage.

Although I have a general interest in the entire field of computing, my primary research areas include:

+ Digital Forensics
+ Anti-forensic tools
+ Digital Forensics XML
+ File system analysis
+ Windows Registry analysis
+ Wireless networking and security

Additionally, I have a passion for the Linux operating system and the Python programming language. I am also an avid supported of the Free Software Foundation, the Open Source Initiative and attempt to adopt an open and public research philosophy.
